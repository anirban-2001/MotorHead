                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Tata Sumo<span class="text-muted"> a MUV</span></h2>
                <p class="lead">The Sumo was launched in 1994 as a ten-seater rear-wheel-drive SUV primarily designed
                    for military use and off-road transport.It saw great sales success, and more than 100,000 Sumo
                    vehicles were sold prior to 1997.
                    The Sumo was based on the Telcoline's Tata X2 body-on-frame platform with a redesigned and
                    strengthened rear axle to adapt it to off-road use with part-time all-wheel drive (rear-wheel drive
                    with the option of traction in off-road situations only) with grafting system an electric control up
                    to 60 km/h, self-locking rear differential and manual block front hubs, then eliminated in favor of
                    the fully automatic solution. The front suspension is a double swinging trapezium and torsion bar,
                    while a salisbury type beam rear axles with parabolic leaf springs and antiroll bar has been adopted
                    at the rear. The front brakes are a ventilated disc combined to the rear which is a self-adjusting
                    drum.

                    In the Indian market the rear-wheel drive version was sold to the civilian market, the four-wheel
                    drive was sold to fleets and the Indian army. In the export market the 4WD version was regularly
                    sold alongside the 2WD.

                    Prior to the Sumo, the Indian market had stagnated, where the most modern vehicles in the same class
                    were from Mahindra and Mahindra, primarily derived from the original Willys Jeep models. Upon
                    release, Tata Sumo quickly captured a major segment of the utility automobile market in India.

                    The Sumo name comes from Sumant Moolgaokar, a former MD of Tata Motors.

                    The engine was the same as the Telcoline: the 2.0-liter (1,948 cc) four-cylinder diesel Peugeot XD88
                    naturally aspirated manufactured under license by Tata Motors in India with two valves per cylinder
                    and indirect injection with pre-chamber and 63 horsepower. The gearbox is a G76 5-speed manual.

                    In 1996 the Sumo range was updated with the new more refined "Deluxe" version. In 1998 Tata
                    introduced turbocharged version of the Peugeot XD88 2,0 litre diesel engine for the export market,
                    the new engine is homologated Euro 2 and has an output of 92 horsepower.

                    In 2001 the Sumo Deluxe Turbo with 2.0 TDi engine was introduced in India</p>

                <p class="lead">The Mahindra Bolero is a SUV produced by Mahindra & Mahindra
                    The basic design is based on the Mahindra Armada Grand. The first-generation Bolero was equipped
                    with a Peugeot 2.5 L (150 in3) IDI engine which produced 76 PS (56 kW), although turbocharged
                    versions with or without an intercooler were also available, raising power to 95 or 101 PS (70 or 74
                    kW) respectively The second generation was released with slightly modified exteriors (a larger
                    grille being the most obvious change) and the major change was the engine, a 2.5 L (150 in3)
                    in-house engine from Mahindra. It is powered by a 72 PS (53 kW) 2,523 cc (154.0 cu in) turbocharged
                    direct injection diesel engine.
                    In September 2011, the third generation Bolero was released, with a more thoroughly re-designed
                    front with jewelled headlamps. In India it is powered by the 63 PS (46 kW) M2DiCR diesel engine
                    with a "soft turbo", mated to a five-speed transmission.[4] This latest engine meets the Bharat IV
                    emissions standards.</p>

                        Trax.</span></h2>
                <p class="lead">The Trax is a series of "Multi Utility Vehicles" (MUVs) built by Force Motors in Pune,
                    India (the company was called "Bajaj Tempo" at the time of introduction). There has also been an SUV
                    version called the Gama, especially aimed at private buyers, while the vehicle also receives many
                    additional names such as Cruiser, Gurkha, and Judo.

                    The vehicles are of simple and durable construction, suited for the severe conditions found in the
                    Indian countryside. Originally there were three models; the Town and Country, the Trax Challenger,
                    and the Pick-up. In 1998, the four-wheel drive "Tempo Trax Gurkha" was introduced, originally aimed
                    mostly at military users.[1] Since then, a plethora of versions have appeared: open top SUVs,
                    comparatively luxurious station wagons, dropside pickups (Kargo King), ambulances, vans, and many
                    special bodies are offered on three different wheelbases of 2,400 mm (94 in), 3,030 mm (119 in)
                    (Kargo King),[2] or 3,050 mm (120 in).[3] The Trax can hold up to 13 passengers in the LWB versions.

                    The engines used were originally versions of Mercedes-Benz OM616 2.4 litre four-cylinder diesel,
                    with an available turbo version for the top-of-the-line Trax Gurkha, but these have been replaced by
                    a larger 2.6 L (2,596 cc) TD 2650 F, still Mercedes derived. Power is 61 hp (45 kW) at 3,200 rpm,
                    with a 75 hp (56 kW) turbocharged and intercooled version (TD 2650 FTI) used for the 4x4 Gurkha
                    version.[3]

                    In Philippines, Tempo Trax rebadged version, Togo Tracker is locally made by Morales Motors. The
                    Tracker also offered as passenger van or chassis cab for jeepneys and utility trucks.</p>

                    Isuzu from 1991 until 2020 and developed in Indonesia for the Southeast Asian market. The second
                    generation Panther was also manufactured and marketed in India under the name Chevrolet Tavera, a
                    name which is also used in Indonesia for the petrol version until 2005. It was developed together
                    with General Motors as the "160 Project".[3]

                    The model is suited to carrying large loads of passengers or cargo. It was developed to meet local
                    conditions in terms of climate, roads and family structure as a durable vehicle. The Panther was
                    also known in the Philippines as the Hi-Lander, later as the Crosswind. It was also known as the
                    Hi-Lander in Vietnam.</p>

                </h2>
                <p class="lead">The Toyota Innova is a compact MPV manufactured by the Japanese automaker Toyota since
                    2004. It is first produced in Indonesia under supervision by Toyota-Astra Motor since 2004 and has
                    been manufactured in other countries as well. Its official name in Indonesia is Toyota Kijang
                    Innova, while for other countries it is simply called "Innova" (also as "Innova Crysta" in India and
                    Thailand since the second generation).

                    As with the Kijang, which it replaced, the Innova has a body-on-frame chassis shared with the Hilux
                    pickup truck and the Fortuner SUV under the IMV project instead of a monocoque chassis commonly used
                    by MPVs as due to the perceived strength and durability which is preferred by customers mainly in
                    Indonesia.[1]

                    The Innova was also introduced as a replacement for both the Kijang as well as its rebadged
                    derivatives in foreign markets, including the Qualis in India, the Unser in Malaysia, the Tamaraw
                    FX/Revo in the Philippines, and the Zace in Vietnam. The Innova is also sold in Thailand, Cambodia,
                    Brunei, the Middle East, Myanmar, Ecuador, Egypt, Jamaica, and Argentina.

                    The name "Innova" comes from the English word "innovation".</p>

                <p class="lead">
                    The Mahindra Xylo was a compact
                        MPV designed and manufactured by the Indian automobile manufacturer Mahindra & Mahindra
                    The project of the vehicle, codenamed "Ingenio", was first announced by Mahindra in 2006 and was
                    designed to compete in the Indian market with the Toyota Innova and the Chevrolet Tavera. The
                    project cost the company around Rs 550 crore. Production was started in Mahindra's Nashik plant
                    in December 2008.

                    Pre-facelift (2009–2012)
                    The Xylo was launched in India on 13 January 2009, with sales started in March 2009. Prior to its
                    launch, more than 3,000 units were sold in the first full month.[5] However, since then, sales have
                    slowly declined, it is widely believed that the sales have not lived up to Mahindra's expectations.
                    The Xylo was loosely based on the ladder frame platform from the Mahindra Scorpio. The chassis was
                    modified in order to take account of the Xylo's longer wheelbase and higher refinement requirements.
                    It is available with a number of seating configurations, including a 8-seater with two up front and
                    two benches, or a 7-seater with two up front, middle-row captain seats and a rear bench. For safety
                    features, some trim levels may come standard with dual front airbags and ABS with EBD.

                    Originally, the Xylo was also rumored to have four-wheel-drive models, various test mules have been
                    spotted on undergoing trials. However, none of the four-wheel-drive Xylos were ever being brought to
                    the market. It might be likely due to the company's fears of cannibalization to the sales of the
                    Mahindra Scorpio, as well to a reluctance to invest further in development costs of an
                    underperforming model.[citation needed]

                    Facelift (2012–2019)
                    The Mahindra Xylo was comprehensively updated in 2012, featuring new transmissions and a modern
                    2.2-litre mHawk turbo-diesel engine for higher trim levels. Other changes includes a revised
                    suspension tuning, a restyled front fascia, smoked rear taillights, blacked out window pillars, and
                    leather interiors for the top-of-the-line H9 model. In June 2012, sales have crossed the mark of
                    100,000 units. The Xylo received some minor cosmetic changes again in late 2013, including side body
                    decals and a bonnet chrome strip. As of January 2015, it is offered in five trim levels: D2, D4, H6,
                    H8 and H9.[citation needed]

                    In addition to India, the Xylo was also sold in some selected international markets, including South
                    Africa, Colombia, and a few various parts of Southern Asian and North African countries. It is
                    rumored that the production of the Xylo might ended in 2018, but Mahindra decides that they would
                    keep the production of the Xylo until further notice. In June 2019, Mahindra announces that the Xylo
                    will be discontinued due to the stricter crash safety and BS-VI emission standards, that would take
                    place in March 2020. The Xylo will be eventually replaced by the Mahindra Marazzo.</p>
